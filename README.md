This version of CloverEFI is only applicable to the ThinkPadx200 (7458E69) version. The memory must be 4GB, but it can also be 2GB. However, I have not tested it before, but the maximum version can only be 10.13.6. If you have any ideas, please contact me. Additionally, the itlwm.kext network driver used needs to be used in conjunction with HeliPort, which will be included in the zip package.
